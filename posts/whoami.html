          <h1>~ &gt; whoami</h1>
          <p>I’m a Ukrainian student and a unix/linux & open-source enthusiast, trying to get into cybersecurity, gain
            some practical skills.</p>

          <h2>My interests are:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Cybersecurity</li>
            <li>Low-level programming: C, Rust, Zig, C++, Assembly</li>
            <li>Reverse engineering (IDA, Ghidra, NinjaBinary)</li>
            <li>Electrical engineering</li>
            <li>PCB designing (KiCad — yet to try)</li>
            <li>Self-hosting</li>
            <li>A little bit of 3D</li>
            <li>A little bit of game development</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Self-hosting</h2>
          <p>I have a Raspberry Pi 5 with 4GB of RAM running DietPi and nixpkgs (I hate outdated Debian packages).</p>
          <p>Currently hosting a bunch of stuff on it via Docker containers with help of desec.io.</p>

          <h2>Some project I have</h2>
          <h3><a class="post-title" href="https://git.forsen-cock.dedyn.io/elleoma/facinus">Facinus</a></h3>
          <p>Since our college switched from Windows to Ubuntu, I had a cool idea to remotely control my classroom PCs.
          </p>
          <p>I discovered <code>gsocket.io</code> and started developing a tool that deploys a local web admin panel to
            collect logs from connected clients.</p>
          <p>I used an Ubuntu VM in QEMU and Bash scripted everything with some help of AI.</p>

          <hr />

          <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
          <p>I’ve been into cybersecurity for about 2 years now. I started with the normie setup — Kali Linux
            dual-booted next to Windows, learning through trial and error.</p>
          <p>Eventually I spent more time on Linux, moved to KDE, configured everything myself, riced my terminal. Later
            switched to Arch and Hyprland.</p>
          <p>I still have lots to learn, and I’d love to document all the tools and techniques I come across.</p>

          <h3>HackTheBox</h3>
          <p>HTB gave me that initial hands-on boost I needed.As of right now I’ve solved more than 50 boxes (3 of them
            “Insane”: DarkCorp, Mist, and MassGarden).</p>
          <p>Even though I sometimes rely on writeups and walkthroughs, I learn a lot from the infrastructure behind
            each box.</p>
          <p>I’m not sure if using writeups spoils the learning, but for now it gives me clarity and saves time. I aim
            to shift toward solving without spoilers in the future.</p>

          <h3>Russian targets</h3>
          <p>I’m Ukrainian, so I practice skills on real russian infrastructure. It’s morally right and beneficial,
            especially in these times.</p>

          <h2>Bug bounty</h2>
          <p>Bug bounty is fascinating — legally hacking in-scope apps and possibly earning money.</p>
          <p>But as a beginner, it’s tough. Recon is time-consuming, and rewards don’t always justify the effort unless
            you're really skilled.</p>
          <p>I’ve tried a few programs but haven't found any serious vulnerabilities yet. I plan to shift my focus
            toward learning specific attack techniques and improving my skills first.</p>

          <hr />

          <h2>My setup</h2>
          <p>I use Arch Linux on a laptop — it just works and lets me get things done. I run Hyprland and use NVChad for
            Neovim.</p>

          <p>Here’s my <code>fastfetch</code> output:</p>
